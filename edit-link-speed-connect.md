# Editing the link speed for a Direct Link Exchange Classic connection
{: #how-to-edit-the-link-speed-for-an-ibm-cloud-direct-link-exchange-connection}

You can edit your connection's link speed on either side of the connection, starting from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} side or the provider's edge server. You are allowed to change the link speed only one time per month.
{:shortdesc}

1. Complete Steps 1 and 2 in [Provisioning Direct Link Exchange Classic](/docs/infrastructure/direct-link?topic=direct-link-provisioning-ibm-cloud-direct-link-exchange).
2. If the connection is in **Provisioned**, **Up**, or **Down** status, you can edit the connection by clicking the **Actions** column next to the connection.
3. In the order form, you can select the new link speed. As you select the link speed, you see an approximate monthly charge that is displayed in the right panel.
4. Complete Steps 2 - 5 in [Provisioning Direct Link Exchange Classic for Equinix](/docs/infrastructure/direct-link?topic=direct-link-provisioning-ibm-cloud-direct-link-exchange-for-equinix).

   You must agree to the Direct Link Automation Terms before you can place the IBM Cloud Direct Link order. Also read the IBM Cloud Terms and Conditions carefully because they contain important technical information that you must understand before proceeding.

    If you try to edit the link speed before the 30 days' expiration, an error message is displayed.
