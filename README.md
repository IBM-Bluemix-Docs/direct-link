This repository contains documentation that covers four offerings:

* Direct Link Connect
* Direct Link Exchange
* Direct Link Dedicated
* Direct Link Dedicated Hosting (that's colocation)

These offerings share so much that it made sense when moving these files over from KnowledgeLayer during 2017-2018 to have them all in a single repository.
