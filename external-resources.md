## IBM Cloud solution tutorials

* [**Isolate workloads with a secure private network** ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-secure-network-enclosure#isolate-workloads-with-a-secure-private-network)

## Papers and case studies

* [**Hybrid Cloud White Paper** ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://public.dhe.ibm.com/cloud/bluemix/network/direct-link/ibm-hybrid-cloud-whitepaper.pdf)

    **Abstract:** Krystallize Technologies set up three different “real world” configurations, using the architecture described in this paper, to design a dedicated, low-latency, private connection between cloud services and customer-provided network equipment, storage, and compute infrastructure that is durable and affordable. 

    This paper presents test results showing how a well-designed, well-executed, hybrid cloud architecture performs versus one that leverages standard facilities, using connections and an architecture not optimized for application performance.

* [**Case Study for Direct Link and IBM Cloud** ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://public.dhe.ibm.com/cloud/bluemix/network/direct-link/ibm-cloud-case-study.pdf)

    **Abstract:** As IBM Cloud needed to expand its global data center footprint to meet burgeoning demand for its Infrastructure-as-a-Service offering, it needed the right data center partner to achieve the best available combination of power, space, and price.

    Delivery systems that put extra steps between server deployments, cloud and customers were too slow and indirect to deliver the low latency and high throughput IBM Cloud promises its customers. 

    Choosing to co-locate at Digital Realty’s hub locations in APAC and the U.S. puts IBM Cloud Data Centers right next door to Digital Realty’s world-class data center deployments, with direct dark fiber connection between them.
