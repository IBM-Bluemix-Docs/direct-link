# What's New
{: #what-s-new}

Check back regularly to see what's new with {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Direct Link. We're growing daily!

## March 2019
{: #march-2019}

March has been a very busy month for Direct Link.

* To improve customer experience and provide greater value, we are enhancing the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Direct Link Global Routing Service.
* We have added several new partners for Direct Link Connect. Those are listed later in this section.

Please review the [full text of our announcement](docs/direct-link?topic=direct-link-announcement-global-routing-policy-change-begins-july-1) about changes to Global Routing.

### Expanded local markets
{: #march-2019-expanded-local-markets}

We have expanded the Direct Link Local Markets to provide more local routing options to our customers globally. The new Local Market assignments are listed below:

* The Dallas local Market will now include Denver, Houston and Chicago PoPs.
* The Washington DC local Market will now include New York , Atlanta and Miami PoPs.
* The San Jose local market will now include the Los Angeles PoP .
* The Oslo local market will now include the Stockholm PoP.
* The Sydney local market will now include the Perth PoP.
* The Hong Kong local market will include the Taipei PoP once launched.
* The Tokyo local market will include the Osaka PoP once launched.
* The Chennai local market will include the Mumbai PoP once launched.

These changes are outlined in tables found at [Expanded IBM Direct Link Local Markets](/docs/infrastructure/direct-link?topic=direct-link-pricing-for-ibm-cloud-direct-link#expanded-ibm-cloud-direct-link-local-markets).

### Withdrawing of Global Routing network transit overage charges
{: #march-2019-withdrawing-of-global-routing-network-transit-overage-charges}

We have withdrawn the network transit limits and overage charges for customers with the Global Routing option. Previous pricing included network transit allowances and overage charges for egress traffic outside of the customer’s local market. New pricing eliminates these network traffic charges. Henceforth, ingress and egress traffic across Direct Link connections will not incur overages.
