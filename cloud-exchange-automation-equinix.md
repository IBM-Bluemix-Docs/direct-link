# Provisioning IBM Cloud Direct Link Exchange for Equinix
{: #provisioning-ibm-cloud-direct-link-exchange-for-equinix}

If the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Direct Link order is for the Equinix Cloud Exchange, the service provisioning is fully automated, which means that you can place an order for an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Direct Link connection (Equinix) without opening an IBM support ticket.

Automation capabilities currently are limited to the Equinix Cloud Exchange. In subsequent releases, automation will be enabled for other providers.
{:note}

## Prerequisites
{: #cloud-exchange-equinix-prerequisites}

To use the automated ordering capability, your private VLANs must be associated with a VRF in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network. If this requirement is not met, an IBM support ticket will be generated when you place the order through the Customer Portal.

## Steps for ordering and provisioning
{: #cloud-exchange-steps-for-ordering-and-provisioning}

**Step 1:**

Follow the steps from 1 through 7 from the regular [Cloud Exchange ordering steps](/docs/infrastructure/direct-link?topic=direct-link-provisioning-ibm-cloud-direct-link-exchange).

**Step 2:**

Once you place the order, the IBM Cloud Direct Link provisioning begins.

**Step 3:**

You can see the status of your connection after you place the order. If the configuration completes on the IBM side successfully, you'll see the status as **Provisioned**. If the configuration is not finished, you'll see the status as **In-Progress**. If the configuration has failed, you'll see the status as **Create Failed**. If the configuration has completed successfully and the BGP connection is up, you'll see the status as **UP**.

The following figure shows various states of the connection after the order is placed:

**Step 4:**

If the connection is in **Provisioned** status, expand the connection by clicking the **>** in front of the connection **Name**. Then note down the **Customer IP Address** and **Service Key** information. These will be needed for configuring the customer edge router and as the authorization key for the cloud-provider-side (Equinix) configuration, respectively.

**Step 5:**

For the connections in **Provisioned** status, after expanding the connection by clicking the **>** in front of the connection, you'll see an error message if there is a mismatch with Peer Link Speed. Once the Speed is the same on the IBM side and the Equinix Side, this Error notification is no longer displayed.

**Step 6:**

For the connections in the **Create Failed** status, an IBM support ticket is generated and further details are communicated through the support ticket. When you expand the connection, you can see the support ticket details.

![Step 12](/images/Equinix-Step12-CreateFailed.png)

**Step 7:**

For the connections in **Provisioned**, **UP** or **DOWN** status, you can **Delete** the connection by clicking on the **ACTIONS** column next to the connection.

![Step 13](/images/Equinix-Step13-Delete.png)

**Step 8:**

For the connections in **Create Failed** status, you can **Cancel** the connection by clicking on the **ACTIONS** column next to the connection.
